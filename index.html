<h1>Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe</h1>
<p>My dad's recipe is way better, but I feel like I have to use the recipe provided in the lesson.</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>&#190; cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>&#190; cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 &#188; cups all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>&#189; teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped nuts (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and 
    vanilla extract until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients 
    to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
    <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
    <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before 
    transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
</ol>
